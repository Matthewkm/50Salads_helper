# Convenient 50Salads Dataset Action Labels

I was unable to find coherient and conventiant labels for the [50 Salads dataset](https://cvip.computing.dundee.ac.uk/datasets/foodpreparation/50salads/), so created these frame level segment labels to hopefully help with consistent training across works

## Usage

Download the RGB videos from the official 50 Salads [download page](https://cvip.computing.dundee.ac.uk/datasets/foodpreparation/50salads/data/)

Decode the video (to be added)

The frame level labels and splits within the Frame_Lables and Splits folder should allow for training on RGB frames belonging to the 17 (+ 2 start and end background) classes utilised within other works.
